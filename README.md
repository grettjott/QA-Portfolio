# About
Hello, my name is Greta, and I am changing my career to the IT field as a Junior QA Specialist. :wave:

With experience in branding, social media, and packaging design, I'm now shifting to a Quality Assurance Engineer role. I have currently completed Quality Assurance studies at CodeAcademy and I'm using my creative background and attention to detail to excel in this new path. Iâ€™m excited to put these new skills into practice at the earliest opportunity.
